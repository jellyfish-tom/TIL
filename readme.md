# TIL - Things I Learned

Originally title should be "Today I Learned" but I'll be honest with you. 
I have not learned all those things below during one day. 
Ufff! Now when we have that one out the picture, we can keep going. 
I've named mine collection Things I Learnt. 
In another moment of honesty I would admit that I did that accidentaly and there is no evidence of that mistake anywhere, anymore. 

Talking about good introduction, huh?

## About

TIL is acronym for "Today I learned". Not sure from whom original idea came from, but 
people are creating collections of personalized learning history, I believe mostly, here, on Github. 
Collections have form of short notes on some subject. 

I though I'll join the party, as:
* it's useful source for myself to recall things
* being able to share it with fellow developers sounds nice
* a way to keep myself motivated by being able to see how much I already know
* keep pushing to make this collection HUUUUUGE - basically LEARN ALL THE THINGS
* writing things down tends to have 
  positive effect on remembering.

Most of my notes are not providing full info on the subject. 
They often try to cover whole spectrum of the subject, but ex. only by mentioning keywords.
They assume some kind of preexisting knowledge on each subject and are being more of a bullet points so you/I can recall whole info easier, or have concise data to search for more.

## Usage

Contents are placed in wiki of this repo as I find it easier to manage it so.
