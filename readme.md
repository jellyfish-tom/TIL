# TIL - Things I Learned

Originally title should be "Today I Learned" but I'll be honest with you - I have not learned all those things in one day. 

## About

TIL is acronym for "Today I learned". Not sure from whom original idea came from, but 
people are creating collections of personalized learning history, I believe mostly, here, on Github. 
Collections have form of short notes on some subject. 

Most of my notes are not providing full info on the subject. 
They often try to cover whole spectrum of the subject, but ex. only by mentioning keywords.
They assume some kind of preexisting knowledge on each subject and are being more of a bullet points so you/I can recall whole info easier, or have concise data to search for more.

## Usage

Contents are placed in wiki of this repo as I find it easier to manage it so.
